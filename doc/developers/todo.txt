TO DO
Exception on non-integer motion ID
As a member, I would like to be able to see the roll call for a motion so that I can lobby my peers and hold them accountable for their votes.
As a member, I would like for votes to expire so that motions can take effect in reasonable time.
As a constituent, I would like to be able to see all adopted motions so that I know what the rules are.
As a member, I would like to be able to update my vote before the time expires.
As a user, I would like to log out so that other people can log in and so that other people can't hijack my session.
As a user, I would like to be confident that my password does not appear in a bunch of log files.
As a user, I would like my password to be stored in a database rather than checked in to Git so that people can't just see it on GitHub and so that I can change it without waiting for a release.
As a user, I would like motions to be persisted in a database so that we don't lose our entire archive whenever Dolan trips over the power cord.
As a user, I would like my password to be hashed and salted so that if it is stoled by haxxorz they will not be able to use it to log in.
As a user, I would like for exception traces to be hidden from web visitors so that attackers find it harder to recon the server, so that they have more difficulty compromising my info.
