TO DO
As a user, I would like to log out so that other people can log in and so that other people can't hijack my session.
As a user, I would like my password to be stored in a database rather than checked in to Git so that people can't just see it on GitHub and so that I can change it without waiting for a release.
As a user, I would like my password to be hashed and salted so that if it is stoled by haxxorz they will not be able to use it to log in.
