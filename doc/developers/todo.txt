TO DO
As a member, I would like for votes to expire so that motions can take effect in reasonable time.
As a member, I would like to know what the deadline is to vote on a motion so that I can debate and vote in a timely manner.

As a user, I would like motions to be persisted in a database so that we don't lose our entire archive whenever Dolan trips over the power cord.

As a user, I would like to log out so that other people can log in and so that other people can't hijack my session.
As a user, I would like to be confident that my password does not appear in a bunch of log files.
As a user, I would like my password to be stored in a database rather than checked in to Git so that people can't just see it on GitHub and so that I can change it without waiting for a release.
As a user, I would like my password to be hashed and salted so that if it is stoled by haxxorz they will not be able to use it to log in.
As a user, I would like for exception traces to be hidden from web visitors so that attackers find it harder to recon the server, so that they have more difficulty compromising my info.

As a member, I would like to see the status of a motion on the motion detail view.
As a constituent, I would like motions to be placed in separate areas depending on their status so that it's easy to get a view of the organization's status at a glance.
