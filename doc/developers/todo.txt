TO DO

As a user, I would rather log in with my Google account than with basic auth so that I don't have to remember yet another password.
As a constituent, I would like to view the proceedings so that I can be sure the members are behaving.
Exception when submitting a username that does not exist.
As a user, I would like motions to be persisted in a database so that we don't lose our entire archive whenever Dolan trips over the power cord.

<at this point we can set up a demo instance>

As a user, I would like to log out so that other people can log in and so that other people can't hijack my session.
As a user, I would like to be confident that my password does not appear in a bunch of log files.
As a user, I would like for exception traces to be hidden from web visitors so that attackers find it harder to recon the server, so that they have more difficulty compromising my info.

<at this point we can become self-hosting>

[Need a spike: What do we have to add to be adopted by other orgs?]

As a member, I would like to see deadlines in my local time.
As a member, I would like to see the status of a motion on the motion detail view.
As a constituent, I would like motions to be placed in separate areas depending on their status so that it's easy to get a view of the organization's status at a glance.
